# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will make the logo background transparent so that it seamlessly blends with the body background color, creating a more cohesive visual design. The logo should appear to have no background and inherit the visual context of its container.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want the logo to have a transparent background, so that it visually integrates with the page design without a distracting background color or box.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN the logo SHALL display with a transparent background
2. WHEN the body background color changes THEN the logo SHALL continue to appear seamlessly integrated without any visible background
3. WHEN viewing the logo THEN it SHALL NOT display any background color, border, or visual container that conflicts with the page design

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the logo transparency to be implemented through CSS, so that it can be easily maintained and modified without requiring image editing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the transparency THEN the solution SHALL use CSS properties to achieve the transparent effect
2. WHEN the logo is displayed THEN it SHALL maintain its visual quality and readability
3. IF the logo has an existing background THEN the CSS SHALL override or remove any background styling
